L222770 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
L222769 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ What kindness?
L222768 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
L222766 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.
L222765 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ Then why weep for him?
L222764 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ And he drove me to mine.
L222763 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ You drove him to his torment.
L222762 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I am as he made me. In his own image.
L222761 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ What is that to you? Evil as you are.
L222760 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
L222759 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I was watching.
L222758 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ Yes.
L222757 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ You were with him at the end.
L222502 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I am afraid.
L222501 +++$+++ u974 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ People can be kinder than you think.
L222500 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
L222499 +++$+++ u974 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Why do you not go to them?
L222498 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Yes. Very close
L222497 +++$+++ u974 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Friends? Do they live around here?
L222496 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
L222495 +++$+++ u974 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ You're an outcast.
L222493 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Worse.
L222492 +++$+++ u974 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ It can't be as bad as that.
L222491 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
L222490 +++$+++ u974 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Why?
L222489 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Better that way... for me.
L222488 +++$+++ u974 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
L222487 +++$+++ u974 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ The music? Or the fire?
L222486 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Nice.
L222739 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
L222738 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
L222734 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
L222733 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ She's not for you.
L222732 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ She's beautiful.
L222677 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night. I'll be with you on yours.
L222676 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I will not! Kill me now!
L222675 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ You will honor your promise to me!
L222674 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ No. I draw the line.
L222673 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
L222672 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ This was not taken from a grave.
L222671 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ A brain. Extremities.
L222670 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ What is this?
L222664 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Her body pleases me.
L222663 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Why... her?
L222642 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I'll be waiting. And watching.
L222641 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Yes. I want this over and done with.
L222640 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Soon?
L222639 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
L222638 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ And if I consent?
L222637 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
L222636 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
L222635 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
L222634 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Friend?
L222633 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ There is something I want.  A friend.
L222632 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ What can I do?
L222631 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
L222630 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I don't know.
L222629 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
L222628 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
L222627 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
L222626 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
L222625 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Materials. Nothing more.
L222624 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
L222623 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
L222622 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
L222615 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
L222614 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I see it before me.
L222613 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
L222612 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
L222611 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Your crime... as well as mine.
L222610 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
L222609 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
L222608 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
L222607 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Kill you? Hardly that.
L222606 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Kill me and have done with it.
L222605 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
L222604 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ How did you find me?
L222603 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
L222602 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ You speak.
L222601 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Come warm yourself if you like.
L222540 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Fine.
L222539 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Are you all right?
L222388 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
L222387 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
L222386 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
L222385 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I should go. I should leave today.
L222384 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ So have I
L222383 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
L222382 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ It's been months. It's not like him.
L222381 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Nothing. Still nothing.
L222311 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
L222310 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Must've been a terrible row.
L222186 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ And you look so lovely.
L222185 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ You dance so beautifully together.
L222182 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
L222181 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
L222180 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
L222176 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Quite right!
L222175 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
L222170 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ There, there... shhh...
L222169 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Poor William! What indignant tears!
L222545 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ It's far too late for him to still be out.
L222544 +++$+++ u973 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
L222543 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Is he not back yet?
L222542 +++$+++ u973 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Have you seen Willie?
L222527 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
L222526 +++$+++ u973 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ What does it say?
L222313 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
L222312 +++$+++ u973 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ He always was opinionated.
L222713 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Open this door for no-one!
L222712 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Victor!
L222711 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I have been waiting for this ever since.
L222710 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
L222709 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Now husband and wife.
L222708 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Brother and sister no more.
L222686 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I do. But you must trust me for now.
L222685 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
L222684 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
L222683 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
L222682 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
L222681 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ It is
L222680 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
L222679 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Why the change? What about your work?
L222678 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
L222655 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
L222654 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
L222653 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ So do I.
L222652 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
L222651 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
L222650 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ What sort of task?
L222644 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I'm all right. I'm safe,
L222643 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I thought I'd never see you again!
L222599 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
L222598 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
L222597 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
L222596 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
L222595 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I've no choice
L222594 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
L222593 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
L222223 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Elizabeth. My more than sister.
L222222 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Victor. I love you,
L222221 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ ...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
L222220 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I give you my soul...
L222219 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Your decision. For us.
L222218 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Our decision. Together.
L222217 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Not as weak as I.
L222216 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ You make me weak.
L222213 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I will be here when you return.
L222212 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Only you.
L222211 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
L222210 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
L222209 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I wish to be your wife.
L222208 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I wish to be your husband.
L222207 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Brother and sister still?
L222206 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Is that what makes it so delicious?
L222205 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ This feels... incestuous.
L222204 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ All my life I've known.
L222203 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I've loved you all my life
L222200 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
L222199 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ You will.  What do you want, Victor?
L222198 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I'll have to do better than that.
L222197 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
L222196 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ And you?
L222195 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Father's so proud.
L222194 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Quite a send-off, isn't it?
L222193 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Smell the air. Wonderful.
L222178 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
L222177 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
L222174 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
L222173 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
L222172 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ The world is a dizzying place.
L222171 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
L222167 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
L222166 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ God took her from us.
L222165 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
L222164 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ What kind of God is He to will this?
L222163 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
L222162 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
L222145 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Nothing can. Not ever.
L222144 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Are you sure it can't hurt us?
L222142 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Aren't you?
L222141 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Don't cry, Elizabeth.
L222754 +++$+++ u975 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRIGORI +++$+++ Aye, Captain.
L222753 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
L222752 +++$+++ u975 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRIGORI +++$+++ This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
L222751 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ A warming wind.
L222109 +++$+++ u975 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRIGORI +++$+++ Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.
L222108 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
L222107 +++$+++ u975 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRIGORI +++$+++ Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
L222085 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ It wouldn't dare.
L222084 +++$+++ u975 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRIGORI +++$+++ It's going to ram us.
L222354 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ Oh God.
L222353 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Professor?
L222337 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
L222336 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ No. But someday.
L222335 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
L222334 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
L222333 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
L222332 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
L222745 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Let it go.
L222744 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
L222697 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I owe you that. Done.
L222696 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Only if you'll tell me who he is.
L222695 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
L222694 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
L222693 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Are you sure you'll be all right?
L222646 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I didn't find what I was looking for.
L222645 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What happened up there?
L222553 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
L222552 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ For what?
L222551 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Thank you, Henry.
L222550 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Quite a place.
L222435 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
L222434 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ No. They don't.
L222433 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
L222432 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
L222431 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Everything in moderation, Clerval.
L222430 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
L222429 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ You've been going round-the-clock?
L222428 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
L222427 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Is that your diagnosis?
L222426 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
L222425 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ A... week?
L222424 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
L222401 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
L222400 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
L222399 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Yes? And?
L222398 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
L222397 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
L222379 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
L222378 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ How much longer?
L222377 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
L222376 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
L222375 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I've been preoccupied.
L222374 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
L222369 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.
L222368 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ No. He had more important work.
L222367 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
L222366 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
L222365 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ That's blasphemy!
L222364 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I resent God's monopoly.
L222363 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You can't. Death is God's will!
L222362 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
L222361 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You're making a scene!
L222360 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
L222359 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
L222358 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
L222357 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ They'll hang him all the same.
L222356 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
L222355 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ They just caught the man who did it.
L222343 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
L222342 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
L222339 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Somebody has to!
L222338 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Only you would think of that!
L222289 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
L222288 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ ...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
L222287 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
L222286 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Now you've got him started.
L222278 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ It's a letter to my father.
L222277 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
L222276 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ You're a comfort to me, Henry.
L222275 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
L222263 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
L222262 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Quite a few.
L222261 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Can you think of a better reason?
L222260 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Rich old ladies and their daughters?
L222253 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
L222252 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Do you really think I'm mad?
L222251 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I know. You have a way of making an impression.
L222250 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
L222249 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Henry Clerval.
L222248 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
L222247 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Are you having me on?
L222246 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ As a march hare.
L222245 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I am not mad.
L222243 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Very well then.
L222242 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I was just clearing my throat.
L222589 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ I have no knowledge of that.
L222588 +++$+++ u979 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ PROSECUTOR +++$+++ So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
L222587 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
L222586 +++$+++ u979 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ PROSECUTOR +++$+++ Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
L222585 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ I have always loved him.
L222584 +++$+++ u979 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ PROSECUTOR +++$+++ And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
L222583 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
L222324 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Despite the lack of challenge.
L222323 +++$+++ u978 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ KREMPE +++$+++ You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
L222239 +++$+++ u978 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ KREMPE +++$+++ Of Geneva.  Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or mysticism?
L222238 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
L222237 +++$+++ u978 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ KREMPE +++$+++ What is your name?
L222236 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
L222235 +++$+++ u978 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ KREMPE +++$+++ Paracelsus?
L222234 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
L222233 +++$+++ u978 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ KREMPE +++$+++ Philosophical?
L222232 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
L222231 +++$+++ u978 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ KREMPE +++$+++ In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
L222341 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
L222340 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
L222326 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ The strain was evident.
L222325 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
L222320 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
L222319 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ Re-configure the leads?
L222306 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
L222305 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Why?
L222304 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ "...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
L222303 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
L222302 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
L222301 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
L222300 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
L222299 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
L222298 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
L222297 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ Electricity.
L222294 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
L222293 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Preposterous.
L222285 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.
L222284 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ You disdain accepted wisdom?
L222283 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
L222282 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
L222281 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
L222280 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ Victor, explain yourself.
L222279 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Professor Waldman.
L222131 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ My name is Frankenstein...
L222130 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ Who are you?
L222129 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.
L222128 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ Madness?
L222127 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Do you share my madness?
L222126 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
L222125 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
L222124 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
L222123 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Your men are right to be afraid.
L222122 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ You know of it?
L222121 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Creature? A... human like creature?
L222120 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
L222119 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I heard.
L222118 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
L222117 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Ah. An explorer.
L222116 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
L222115 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ How is it you come to be here?
L222114 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ Are you a physician?
L222113 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
L222112 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I'm... dying.
L222111 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
